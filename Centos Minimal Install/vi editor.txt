Hit the Esc key; vim goes into command mode. Then you can type

    :q to quit (short for :quit)
    :q! to quit without saving (short for :quit!)
    :wq to write and quit (think write and quit)
    :wq! to write and quit even if file has only read permission (if file does not have write permission: force write)
    :x to write and quit (similar to :wq, but won't write if there are no changes)
    :qa to quit all (short for :quitall)

When you press :, a : will appear at the bottom of the screen.

Or you can press Esc ZZ (Esc Shift+Z Shift+Z) to write/save if the file was changed, then quit.

Or if you don't want to save changes you can use ZQ instead.

Vim has extensive help, so type Esc:helpReturn and you will have all your answers and even a neat tutorial.
